The Gonzales project. About parsing JS as fast as possible. Anything is allowed as long as your parser does all the work and does it in JS.

Check the `bin/details.html` page for, well... details :)

To run the project in node simply run `bin/cli.js` from the project root. Adjust `data/parsers.js` and `data/sources.js` and toggle `defaultOn` for the entries you want enabled/disabled. `cli.js` does not take any parameters.
